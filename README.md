# Infinite Scroll Block Adder

This project demonstrates a simple **infinite scrolling mechanism** using pure HTML and JavaScript. As the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, new blocks are dynamically added, giving an "infinite scrolling" effect.

---

## ✨ Features
- Dynamically adds blocks on reaching the bottom of the page.
- Beginner-friendly project for understanding DOM Manipulation & Scroll Events.
- No external libraries or frameworks used.

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. The page initially contains a list of blocks.
2. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, a **new block** is appended.
3. This process repeats infinitely as long as the user keeps scrolling.
